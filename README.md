# lily's dumb link fixing bot

discord bot to fix various links in discord messages. this bot specifically:
- fixes twitter and x links using [FixTweet](https://github.com/FixTweet/FixTweet) (also removes tracking strings)
- fixes tiktok links using [vxtiktok](https://github.com/dylanpdx/vxtiktok)
- converts youtube shorts links to regular youtube video links
- removes tracking strings from tumblr links and also rearranges them (i cba to explain this here)

i do have an instance of this bot running but if ur here u might as well just host it urself (or ask me nicely for an invite link for the bot). if ur considering this, u probably already know how to get a discord bot up and running with node. 

if u wanna contribute in any way, feel free.
